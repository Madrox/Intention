# Intention

Yet another simple, distraction-free writing app focused on performance. All
entries are saved to the local `Documents\Intention\:JOURNAL:` folder as json
files where the text entry is HTML.

Written in React+Electron using Antd and React Quill.

## TODO

- Add an app icon
- Export to folder
- Custom file formats per journal
- Journal colors/icons
- Journal linking
